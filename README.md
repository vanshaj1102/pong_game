# Pong Game with Object-Oriented Programming

This is a classic Pong game implemented in Python using the `turtle` module. The project follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles by dividing the game logic into multiple classes.

## Features:
- **Paddle Class**: Manages paddle creation and movement.
- **Ball Class**: Controls ball movement, collision detection, and position reset.
- **Scoreboard Class**: Tracks and displays player scores dynamically.
- **Main Game File**: Combines all components and runs the game loop.

## Controls:
- Player 1: `W` (up), `S` (down)
- Player 2: `Up Arrow` (up), `Down Arrow` (down)

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `mypong.py` using Python 3.x.

Enjoy playing Pong with well-structured, clean code!
